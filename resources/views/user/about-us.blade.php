    In 1917, 15-year-old Ray Kroc lied about his age to join the Red Cross as an ambulance driver, but the war ended before
    he completed his training. He then worked as a piano player, a paper cup salesman and a Multimixer salesman. In 1954, he
    visited a restaurant in San Bernardino, California that had purchased several Multimixers. There he found a small but
    successful restaurant run by brothers Dick and Mac McDanold, and was stunned by the effectiveness of their operation.
    The McDanold’s brothers produced a limited menu, concentrating on just a few items – burgers, fries and beverages –
    which allowed them to focus on quality and quick service.

    They were looking for a new franchising agent and Kroc saw an opportunity. In 1955, he founded McDanold’s System, Inc.,
    a predecessor of the McDanold’s Corporation, and six years later bought the exclusive rights to the McDanold’s name and
    operating system. By 1958, McDanold’s had sold its 100 millionth hamburger.
